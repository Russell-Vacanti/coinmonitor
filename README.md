## Installation
Download the zip, grab the stable folder out of there and put it somewhere safe. Now go type *chrome://extensions* in the top bar. Now, this might get tricky but we have to enable developer mode and select that folder we took out of the zip file earlier. So after enabling dev mode click *load unpacked extension* and select the stable folder. Thats It!
